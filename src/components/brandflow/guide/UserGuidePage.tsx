Every feature is designed to work perfectly for solo brand owners. The dashboard gives you a complete overview of your business at a glance. Orders, products, customers, analytics, and marketing are all accessible from a single interface. Manage everything yourself at your own pace without depending on anyone else." },
    { id: "so2", title: "Quick Order Creation from WhatsApp", content: "When customers message you on WhatsApp with orders, quickly create them in the portal. Go to Orders, click New Order, enter the customer's name and phone, add products, and set the payment method. The entire process takes under 60 seconds. Keep the Orders page open on your phone or second screen while chatting with customers for fastest order entry." },
    { id: "so3", title: "Automated Customer Follow-ups", content: "As a solo owner, you can't manually follow up with every customer. Set up automated WhatsApp or email messages: order confirmation when you create an order, shipping update when you dispatch, delivery thank you message, and a review request 2 days after delivery. These automated messages keep customers informed and build trust without requiring your time." },

    { id: "so5", title: "Financial Tracking Without an Accountant", content: "Use Revenue Analytics to track your daily, weekly, and monthly income. The system calculates gross profit based on your cost prices and selling prices. Export order data as CSV and import it directly into Excel or Google Sheets for expense tracking. Monitor your profit margins per product and per category to identify which items are most profitable for your business." },
    { id: "so6", title: "Growing from Solo to Team", content: "When your business grows beyond what you can handle alone, adding team members is seamless. Start with the Starter plan that supports 3 team members. Invite a friend or family member to help with orders. Assign them a specific role like Sales Rep or Inventory Clerk. They get their own login and can only see features relevant to their role. When you need more members or advanced features, upgrade to Growth (8 members), Professional (15 members), or Enterprise (unlimited). Scale your team as your business grows." },

This system is simple, secure, and doesn't require team members to manage separate passwords." },
    { id: "f6", title: "Do team members need their own subscription?", content: "No! Team members automatically inherit the brand owner's plan features. The subscription is per-organization, not per-user. If the brand owner has Growth plan, all team members get Growth features. If Professional, they get Professional features.

Invest time in product photography as it directly impacts sales." },

Customer retention is 5x cheaper than customer acquisition." },
